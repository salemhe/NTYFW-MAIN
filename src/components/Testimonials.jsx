      "Not too young for wealth is one of the very few platforms that truly embodies the meaning of its name. I was able to attend the maiden edition as a teenager, which went on to serve as part of my foundation for the success Iâ€™ve built so far in my career. It truly gave me the understanding that wealth and riches arenâ€™t respecters of age and can come to you at anytime, once you put in the work From the impact it had in my life, Iâ€™ve gone on to host empowerment programs as an undergraduate, in Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State, that has helped students begin their careers. That, is my most proudÂ achievement"
